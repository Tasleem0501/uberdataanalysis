# Uber Data Analysis & Predictions

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis and prediction of Uber ride data, examining patterns and trends using data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning algorithms. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to help understand and forecast Uber ride demands.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on Uber rides, including:
- **Start and End Dates**: Timestamps for each ride
- **Ride Details**: Category, purpose, location, and miles traveled

This dataset helps uncover behavioral patterns and provides insights into popular ride purposes and peak times.

## Project Structure
- **`uber-data-analysis-predictions.ipynb`**: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing all steps, from loading and cleaning the dataset to visualizations and model training.

## Key Analyses & Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning missing values, handling duplicates, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like `day_name`, `time_label`, `month`, and `duration` to enhance analysis and modeling accuracy.
- **EDA**: Visualized data to reveal patterns in ride purposes, day-wise distributions, time of day, and monthly trends.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Trained various models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and boosting algorithms, to predict ride demand.

## Models Used
Several models were trained and evaluated to find the best performer for this dataset:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
- **XGBoost**
- **LightGBM**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **CatBoost**

## Key Findings

1. **Ride Purpose and Category Analysis**:
   - The majority of rides were taken for business purposes, indicating a high demand for Uber as a business transportation solution.
   - Common ride purposes included "Meeting," "Errand/Supplies," and "Meal/Entertain," showing varied usage across personal and business contexts.

2. **Time-Based Trends**:
   - Rides were more frequent during weekdays compared to weekends, with peaks observed during morning and evening hours, aligning with typical commute patterns.
   - Certain days, such as Tuesday and Thursday, saw higher ride volumes, possibly due to business-related travel.

3. **Monthly and Seasonal Patterns**:
   - January had the highest ride counts, which may be influenced by post-holiday travel or seasonal business activities.
   - Ride demand showed slight seasonal fluctuations, suggesting an opportunity for Uber to adjust its services based on anticipated demand during different times of the year.

4. **Model Performance**:
   - The **XGBoost** model achieved the best accuracy score among the evaluated models, making it the most reliable for predicting ride demand in this dataset.
   - Other models, such as **LightGBM** and **Random Forest**, also performed well, though **Linear Regression** showed poor fit, likely due to non-linear relationships in the data.

## Conclusion

This project successfully explored patterns and trends within Uber ride data and identified key factors that influence demand. Through data visualization, we observed ride purpose, time-based trends, and seasonal patterns that highlight usage patterns for Uberâ€™s services. Predictive modeling helped forecast ride demand, with XGBoost emerging as the most effective model for this dataset.

### Recommendations
- **Dynamic Pricing or Marketing**: Given the identified peak times and days, Uber could consider implementing dynamic pricing or targeted promotions to maximize revenue during high-demand periods.
- **Enhanced Services for Business Travelers**: The high frequency of business-related rides suggests an opportunity for Uber to tailor additional services for corporate customers, such as loyalty programs or corporate accounts.
- **Seasonal Planning**: By understanding monthly trends, Uber can better plan resources and driver availability, especially during anticipated high-demand seasons.

This analysis demonstrates the potential of using data-driven insights and predictive models to optimize services in the ride-hailing industry, paving the way for more strategic decision-making.
